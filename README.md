This repository was created as part of the final project in Linear Algebra 1 at Olin College of Engineering. It deals with
the analysis of the Simple Base Substitution Ceasar Cipher, while also examining the Hill Cipher. Furthermore, we researched on the
VFC method that uses Singular Value Decomposition to analyze texts and compared our results using letter frequency analysis.

Our results were tested by encrypting texts, such as "The Adventures of Mark Twain" and the respective shifted letters were mapped 
based on the SVD values of the matrices determined. Briefly, the theory was validated by taking into account the distance of the points 
from the origin, being the magnitude of the frequency of them accuring.
